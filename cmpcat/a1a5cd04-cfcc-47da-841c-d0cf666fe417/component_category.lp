 (name "AVR 8bits Microcontrollers")
 (description "AVR is a family of microcontrollers developed since 1996 by Atmel, acquired by Microchip Technology in 2016. These are modified Harvard architecture 8-bit RISC single-chip microcontrollers. AVR was one of the first microcontroller families to use on-chip flash memory for program storage, as opposed to one-time programmable ROM, EPROM, or EEPROM used by other microcontrollers at the time.\n\nAVR microcontrollers find many applications as embedded systems. They are especially common in hobbyist and educational embedded applications, Popularized by their inclusion in many of the Arduino line of open hardware development boards.")
